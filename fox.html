        <h1>All About Fennec Foxes</h1>
        <hr>
The smallest of all canids, <b>fennec foxes</b> sport extraordinarily large ears that help them hunt at night. They are native to Africa and Arabia where they live in deserts and arid regions.

<p>Extreme panting helps fennec foxes keep their temperatures regulated when the heat climbs; breathing rates climb from 23 breaths per minute to up to 690.</p>

<h2>Behaviour and ecology</h2>
        <p>in the dream of foxes<br>
            there is a field<br>
            and a procession of women,<br>
            clean as good children
            no hollow in the world<br>
            surrounded by dogs<br>
            no fur clumped <sup>bloody</sup><br>
            on the ground<br>
            only a lovely line<br>
            of honest women stepping<br>
            without fear or guilt or shame<br>
            safe through the generous fields.</p>

<h3>Conservation</h3>
<h4>Fennec fox as a pet</h4>
<p>The fennec fox is bred commercially as an exotic house pet.[9] Commercial breeders remove the pups from their mother to hand-raise them, as tame foxes are more valuable. A breeders' registry has been set up in the United States to avoid any problems associated with inbreeding.</p>
