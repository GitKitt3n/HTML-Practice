        <p>
          Let's start off with what SEO stands for. I was never good with
          acronyms but this is one I come across far too often not to remember.
          SEO stands for search engine optimization. From my reading and years
          of work in eCommerce I know that SEO is the practice of bettering not
          only site visibility but how viewers reach your site.
        </p>
        <h3>A bit about Search Engines</h3>
        <p>
          Search engines are systems that find the information that's out there
          on the web. Search engines can help how often your content is found on
          the web. Eventhough Google is not the only By practicing good SEO
          practice you search tool out there, it does make up about 92% of all
          search volumn according to Kelly Main, writer of
          <a

        <h3>Technical SEO</h3>
        <p>
          Think of search engine optimization as the methods and practices that
          really build your online presence. With SEO the most important types
          are On-Page, Off-Page, and Technical SEO. For Technical SEO you want
          to make sure that you optimize your URL structure, you fix any
          crawling errors, and you have SEO friendly design principles. That
          means that your site is accessible, you have a good internal link
          structure, and you're thinking about UX.
        </p>
        <h3>On-Page SEO</h3>
        <p>
          With on page SEO your want to look at how you optimize your page
          titles because they are what's shown in search results. You want your
          titles to be engaging so viewers make those clicks. You also want to
          make sure your titles have enough information about the actual page
          content. For your images, make sure you have optimized file names and
          use ALT tags! That is a big MUST for images. If for some reason your
          image shows up as broken you have that alt text to describe the image
          that is supposed to be visible.
        </p>
        <h3>Off-Page SEO</h3>
        <p>
          Off page SEO deals more with ways in which you promote your site. This
          means brand promotions, getting backlinks from other sites, and social
          media engagement.
